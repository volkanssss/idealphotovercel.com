Unlike competing applications that offer basic or delayed background removal, our system processes images instantly, allowing users to replace backgrounds on the fly. This technology uses proprietary AI algorithms trained specifically for photobooth environments, resulting in cleaner edges and more natural-looking composite images than what's possible with general-purpose photo editing tools.
